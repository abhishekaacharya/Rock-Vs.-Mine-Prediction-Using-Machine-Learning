# Rock-Vs.-Mine-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a Python implementation of a logistic regression model for predicting whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signals. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
